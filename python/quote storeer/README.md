In this demonstration we have used file I/O using a module called json in this module we open a file to read it as fp in this piece of code ```with open('file.json',  r)as fp:``` and use ```var_name=json.load(variable-that-has-file)```

we also use an ```if/elif/else``` statement to understand what the user wants to do
